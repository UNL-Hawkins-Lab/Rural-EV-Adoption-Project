# Rural-EV-Adoption-Project
This project focuses on Rural EV adoption in the United States. Publically available NHTS data is not included in the repository and will be necessary to run some scripts. We use data and code kindly provided by Prof. Eleftheria Kontou at UIUC from the project "Transportation-Energy-Vunerability".
